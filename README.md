# DSA-Trucks-Project
A truck logistics project for the Data Structures and Algorithms course (CMPE 250) enrolled at Boğaziçi University during MSc in Computer Engineering, Remedial Term.

The project aimed to practice OOP for Java and data structures like linked lists.

Due to plaigarism concerns during the semester, all uploads are bulk uploads (after the course was completed), hence no git commit history.

Input (type... files) and output (type...output) files were provided by the instructor.

Input and output files were left in the current directory due to original code.
